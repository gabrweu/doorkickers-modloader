# API map

Task → call → when it may be called → failure value. The signatures are in `dk2ml.h` (C) and `dk2ml.hpp` (C++
helpers). "Init" means only inside `DK2ML_PluginInit`. "Main" means the main thread: hook callbacks of main-thread
functions, events, tasks and GUI callbacks.

## Pick the least invasive way
| Need | Use | Section |
|---|---|---|
| Code every frame, on state change, map load, GUI reload, window resize | event | [Events](#events) |
| React to a game GUI event (screen opened, `TriggerEvent`) | GUI event | [GUI](#gui) |
| Buttons, text, menus | GUI XML in `mod\gui\` + GUI kit | [GUI](#gui) |
| Player settings | `AddOption` | [Options](#options) |
| Read or write game state | bindings + `Field` | [symbols.md](symbols.md#binding-dk2mlhpp) |
| Call a game function | `dk2ml::Fn` | [symbols.md](symbols.md#binding-dk2mlhpp) |
| Change what a game function does, or observe one no event covers | safe hook | [Hooks](#hooks) |

## Lookups
| Task | C | C++ | When | Failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Function or global address | `ResolveSymbol(name)` | `Fn`, `Global` | any thread | NULL |
| Field offset | `GetFieldOffset(type, field)` | `Field` | any thread | -1 |
| Type size | `GetTypeSize(type)` | `TypeSize` | any thread | 0 |
| Enum value | `GetEnumValue(enum, name, &out)` | `Enum` | any thread | `DK2ML_ERROR` |
| Resolve all bindings | n/a | `ResolveAll(api)` | init | false, with each missing name logged |

## Hooks
| Task | C | C++ | When | Failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Create callbacks (start disabled) | `CreateSafeHook(target, pre, post, user)` | n/a | init, or any thread later | `DK2ML_ERROR`, logged; also once the plugin was switched off |
| Create and enable | n/a | `dk2ml::Hook(api, fn, pre, post, user)` | init, or any thread later | false (target NULL: nothing logged) |
| Enable or disable own callbacks | `EnableHook(target)` / `DisableHook(target)` | n/a | any thread | `DK2ML_ERROR` if no safe hook exists on target |

Callbacks:
```cpp
int  Pre(DK2ML_Regs* regs, void* user);   // return DK2ML_CALL_ORIGINAL (0) or DK2ML_SKIP_ORIGINAL (1)
void Post(DK2ML_Regs* regs, void* user);  // after the original returned
```
| Task | C++ (C) |
|---|---|
| Read argument n (`this` = 0) in pre | `dk2ml::Arg<T>(regs, n)` (`DK2ML_Arg`, `DK2ML_ArgFloat`, `DK2ML_ArgDouble`) |
| Change argument n for the original | `dk2ml::SetArg<T>(regs, n, v)` (`DK2ML_SetArg`, `DK2ML_SetArgFloat`) |
| Read the result in post | `dk2ml::Result<T>(regs)` (`regs->rax`, `DK2ML_ResultFloat`) |
| Set the result in post, or in a pre that skips | `dk2ml::SetResult<T>(regs, v)` (`DK2ML_SetResult`, `DK2ML_SetResultFloat`) |
| Pass data from pre to post for one call | `regs->scratch[0..3]` (uint64) |

Facts:
- Read arguments in the pre. In the post, the argument registers hold whatever the function left.
- `T` for `Arg`/`Result` must fit in 8 bytes and be trivially copyable. A struct over 8 bytes is a pointer (`const T*`).
- Multiple plugins can hook the same target. Pres run in creation order, which follows the mods' order in the Mods menu, and posts in reverse. A skipping pre ends the chain for that call: later callbacks don't run, the skipper's own post doesn't run, and earlier callbacks' posts run with the skipper's result. The log names each skipper once.
- A post always runs if its pre ran, even if the hook was disabled in between.
- Nesting: posts are tracked 64 hooked calls deep per thread. Deeper, callbacks with a post are skipped entirely.
- Crash containment: a crash in a callback is caught, the call continues unhooked, and all of the plugin's hooks, options and GUI callbacks are switched off for the session. Not covered: the plugin's own threads, damage done before the crash, and a crash in a game function the callback called while a post-hooked call sits between them on the stack.
- Register-level details: `DK2ML_Regs` in `dk2ml.h`. Full example: `src\Plugin.cpp` (`UpdateCameraPre`).

## Events
Subscribe in init. Callbacks run on the main thread in subscription order, under crash containment.
`dk2ml::On(api, type, fn, user)` wraps `Subscribe`. A captureless lambda works. Subscribing twice gives two callbacks.

| `DK2ML_EVENT_...` | When | Event fields |
|---|---|---|
| `FRAME` | every frame, inside ImGui's frame; not while a random map generates | `gameClient`, `newState` = the current state |
| `STATE_CHANGED` | `GameClient::m_state` changed, checked once per frame | `oldState`, `newState` (`GameClient::eCGameState`; -1 = no GameClient) |
| `MAP_LOADED` | a mission starts or restarts | `gameClient` |
| `GUI_LOADED` | the game (re)built its GUI. Items found before are gone | |
| `PLUGINS_LOADED` | once, after every plugin's init, before game code. `GetInterface` works from here on | `gameClient` is NULL |
| `WINDOW_RESIZED` | the window's client size changed | `width`, `height` |
| `GUI_EVENT` | a subscribed game GUI event. Use `SubscribeGuiEvent`, not `Subscribe` | `guiEventId`, `guiEventParams` |

- Compare states by name: `dk2ml::Enum StateRunning{"GameClient::eCGameState", "CGAMESTATE_RUNNING"}`, then `e->newState == StateRunning.Get()`. The main menu is `CGAMESTATE_MAIN_MENU`.
- `api->GetGameState()` gives the current state at any time.
- If this game build lacks the names an event needs, the loader logs it and the event never arrives.
- Failure: `DK2ML_ERROR` for an unknown type, `GUI_EVENT`, a NULL fn, or a call after init.

## Options
Settings on the plugin's page of the main menu's "Native mods" screen, drawn with the game's widgets. `AddOption` is
init only and adds in call order. The plugin owns the values. The loader reads `*value` when the screen opens, writes
it when the player changes it, then calls `onChange`, where the plugin saves.

| `DK2ML_OPTION_...` | `value` | Widget | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HEADER` | none | section title | |
| `BOOL` | `bool*` | checkbox | |
| `FLOAT` | `float*` | slider | `max > min`; optional `format`, one `%f`/`%g`/`%e` |
| `INT` | `int*` | slider | `max > min`; optional `format`, one `%d`/`%i` |
| `CHOICE` | `int*` (index) | left/right selector | `choices` with `choiceCount` 1–64 |
| `KEY` | `int*` (virtual-key code) | rebind button | |
| `BUTTON` | none | button | `onChange` runs on click |

- Set `structSize = sizeof(DK2ML_Option)`. `value` must point to static storage. Strings are copied, up to 512 bytes.
- Failure: `DK2ML_ERROR`, with the reason logged. The dry run prints `[dry run] PROBLEM: AddOption "<label>": <reason>`.
- Save to `api->GetConfigDir()` (R16). Pattern: `LoadSettings` before `AddOption`, `SaveSettings` as `onChange`. See `src\Plugin.cpp`.
- The screen exists on the main menu only. In-mission settings need an ImGui window ([cookbook.md](cookbook.md#imgui-window)).

## GUI
Mod GUI: every `.xml` in the mod's `gui\` folder (template: `mod\gui\`) is loaded. Its top-level items join the GUI.
XML rules: action targets must name existing items, `type="None"` is rejected, and `TriggerEvent` accepts only
`GUI::Events::eEventType` names. The game's `data\gui\_config.xml` documents the elements and action types. XML
errors go to the game's `log.txt`.

GUI kit: main thread only, from `GUI_LOADED` on. Every function accepts NULL items. If the kit is unavailable in this
game build, everything returns NULL, 0, `""` or `DK2ML_ERROR`.

| Task | C | C++ (`dk2ml::gui::`) | Failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Find an item by name (recursive; NULL = whole GUI) | `GuiFind(under, name)` | `Find(api, name, under)` | NULL |
| Parent, name, children | `GuiParent`, `GuiName`, `GuiChildren` | `Parent`, `Name`, `Children` | NULL, `""`, 0 |
| Shown flag, show or hide | `GuiIsShown`, `GuiShow` | `IsShown`, `Show` | |
| Set text (StaticText, or Button's 3 state texts) | `GuiSetText(item, utf8)` | `SetText` | `DK2ML_ERROR` for other types. Text is cut to the XML text's length |
| Move under a parent (`ACTION_ADD_CHILD`) | `GuiAddChild(parent, item)` | `AddChild` | `DK2ML_ERROR`. Doesn't show the item |
| Set origin (relative to parent center, +y up) | `GuiSetOrigin(item, x, y)` | `SetOrigin` | `DK2ML_ERROR` |
| Run OnClick actions | `GuiClick(item)` | `Click` | `DK2ML_ERROR` |
| Bind `<Action type="Callback">` to a function | `GuiSetCallback(item, itemEvent, fn, user)` | `OnAction(api, item, itemEvent, fn, user)` | `DK2ML_ERROR` if the item has no Callback action for that event |
| Game GUI event (`GUI::Events::eEventType`) | `SubscribeGuiEvent(id, fn, user)` (init) | `dk2ml::OnGuiEvent(api, id, fn, user)` | `DK2ML_ERROR`, false for id ≤ 0 |

- Item callbacks need XML: `<OnClick><Action type="Callback" target="<an existing item>"/></OnClick>`. Then, after `GUI_LOADED`: `dk2ml::Enum EVENT_CLICK{"GUI::Item::eItemEventType", "EVENT_CLICK"}` and `gui::OnAction(api, item, EVENT_CLICK.Get(), fn)`.
- A clone copies callbacks. Bind on the template before cloning.
- GUI events arrive after the game handled them and can't block it. To block one, safe-hook the game's handler.
- Putting an item into a game menu: an item has one parent. Each frame, if `Parent(item) != target`, call `AddChild`, then `Show`. Code: [cookbook.md](cookbook.md#put-a-button-into-a-game-menu).
- Coordinates: a 2560×1440 canvas, (0,0) at the center, +y up. Don't compute screen positions from `GUI::Item::m_globalOrigin`.

## Input
| Task | Call |
|---|---|
| Is the game window focused | `api->IsGameFocused()`. Check it before `GetAsyncKeyState`, which sees keys from every window |
| Is a game menu open (ignores captures) | `api->IsGameMenuOpen()` / `dk2ml::GameMenuOpen(api)` |
| Keep clicks and keys off the map while your UI is open | `api->CaptureGameInput(1)`, then `0` when closed / `dk2ml::CaptureInput(api, bool)` |
| Rebindable key | `DK2ML_OPTION_KEY` ([Options](#options)). The Native mods screen marks a key bound by another plugin too with "(also <mod>)", so pick unusual defaults |
| Game window (HWND) | `api->GetGameWindow()`, NULL before it exists |

Hotkey pattern: in `FRAME`, `down = IsGameFocused() && (GetAsyncKeyState(vk) & 0x8000)`. Act on `down && !wasDown`,
then store `wasDown = down`. Skip while `IsGameMenuOpen()`. There's no API for "the player is typing".

## Threads and tasks
| Call | Allowed from |
|---|---|
| `AddOption`, `Subscribe`, `SubscribeGuiEvent`, `PublishInterface` | init only |
| `CreateSafeHook` | init, or any thread later |
| `EnableHook`, `DisableHook`, `Log`, lookups, `GetInterface`, `AddTask` | any thread, any time |
| GUI kit, game functions, ImGui | main thread only |

- `AddTask(fn, user)` / `dk2ml::Post(api, fn, user)` runs `fn(user)` on the main thread at the start of the next frame, under crash containment, in the order added. `user` must stay valid until it runs.
- Failure: `DK2ML_ERROR` if fn is NULL, 4096 tasks are queued, the plugin was switched off, or this game build has no frame tick.
- Hook callbacks run on whatever thread the game calls the function on.
- The plugin's own threads aren't crash-contained, keep running after the plugin is switched off (give them their own way to stop), and must not touch game state.

## Interfaces
Plugin-to-plugin function tables.

| Task | C | C++ | When | Failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Publish a table | `PublishInterface(name, version, table)` | `dk2ml::Publish(api, name, version, &table)` | init | `DK2ML_ERROR` if the name is taken or invalid |
| Look one up | `GetInterface(name, minVersion, &version)` | `dk2ml::Get<T>(api, name, minVersion)` | from `PLUGINS_LOADED` on | NULL (always NULL during init) |

- The name is 1–63 printable ASCII characters without spaces, for example `author.mod.Api`. The table's first field is `uint32_t structSize`, new fields go at the end, and the version goes up when fields are added. The table must be static.
- Look the table up on every use. It becomes NULL once the publisher is switched off.
- `dk2ml.log` lists every published interface and its publisher.
- Code: [cookbook.md](cookbook.md#offer-or-use-an-interface).

## Other
| Task | Call | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Log a line | `api->Log(fmt, ...)` | printf-style, to `dk2ml.log`, prefixed with the DLL name. Each line is flushed, so don't log every frame |
| Settings folder | `api->GetConfigDir()` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\KillHouseGames\DoorKickers2\dk2ml\<dll name>\`, trailing `\`, `""` if unavailable |
| Game folder | `api->GetGameDir()` | trailing `\` |
| Plugin and mod paths | `info->pluginPath`, `info->pluginDir`, `info->modDir` | read-only use (R16). `modDir` is empty for `mods_native` |
| Game state | `api->GetGameState()` | -1 = no GameClient |
| Game version | `api->GetGameVersion()` | e.g. 112, 0 if unknown |
| Loader API version | `api->apiVersion` | `DK2ML_API_VERSION` |
| Manifest | `DK2ML_PLUGIN_MANIFEST(minApi, name, version, author, url, gameVersion)` | file scope, once. Read without running code |
