/*
 * dk2ml.h - Door Kickers 2 native mod loader, plugin API.
 *
 * A plugin is a 64-bit DLL that exports DK2ML_PluginInit, in one of:
 *   <enabled mod folder>\native\*.dll   loaded while the mod is enabled in the in-game Mods menu
 *   <game folder>\mods_native\*.dll     always loaded
 * Other DLLs there are dependencies (found in the plugin's folder). A plugin file name already loaded from another mod
 * is skipped.
 *
 * Required export:
 *   int DK2ML_PluginInit(const DK2ML_API* api, const DK2ML_PluginInfo* info);   // 0 = success
 *
 * Init runs on the main thread before any game code, so no game objects exist yet. Install hooks there. Game names
 * resolve from the shipped DoorKickers2.pdb.

/* --- safe hooks ---
 * The game is built with LTCG: callers keep values in ABI-volatile registers (xmm2-5, r8-r11, ...) across calls, and a
 * plain detour clobbers them. A safe hook saves every register around its callbacks and runs the original as the
 * caller set it up. Use safe hooks on all game functions.
 *
 * Chains: pres run in creation order, posts in reverse. A pre returning DK2ML_SKIP_ORIGINAL ends the chain: later
 * callbacks and the skipper's own post don't run; earlier callbacks' posts run at once with the skipper's result.
 * scratch[] is per callback. EnableHook/DisableHook switch only the calling plugin's callbacks. A pre that ran gets
 * its post for that call, even if disabled in between.
 *
 * Nesting: posts are tracked per thread up to 64 hooked calls deep. Deeper, callbacks with a post are skipped entirely
 * (pre too); pre-only callbacks still run.
 *
 * Identical code folding: a hook on a folded address (small getters, trivial virtuals, ...) runs for every function
 * folded into it; the loader logs their names. Check the arguments (e.g. rcx) if that matters.
 *
 * Crash containment: a crashing callback is caught, the call continues as if unhooked, and all of the plugin's hooks
 * pass through from then on. Same if DK2ML_PluginInit crashes or returns non-zero. Not covered: the plugin's own
 * threads, damage done before the crash (e.g. heap corruption), and a crash in a game function the callback calls
 * while a post-hooked call (any plugin's) is between them on the stack. */
